# tf2-crits-reimplemented
Random Crits reimplemented. Used for changing crit calculations to your likings

The RNG generation is not 100% accurate to the game but close enough. 
I used this to prevent crit hacking as well while keeping full control over changing calculations, if i ever need to. 
However it is not stable and crashes at seemingly pseudorandom.
The stack traces were not useful at all so i never was able to figure out what causes them.
You can try it out yourself or even try to figure out the pseudorandom crashes.
